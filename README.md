# train-gates-project
As part of a transportation infrastructure team, I am tasked with designing a logic-based safety system to control the operation of gates at a railway level crossing. This system must ensure that gates are lowered when a train is approaching or a vehicle is still on the tracks and only raised when it is completely safe.
