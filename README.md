# train-gates-project
As part of a transportation infrastructure team, I am tasked with designing a logic-based safety system to control the operation of gates at a railway level crossing. This system must ensure that gates are lowered when a train is approaching or a vehicle is still on the tracks and only raised when it is completely safe. 


Step 1 – Exploring the Problem

This section restates the problem, identifies inputs and outputs, and outlines the context, constraints, and stakeholders involved in designing the system.

Step 2 – Exploring Alternatives

This section presents three possible solutions:

Solution A (Two-Sensor System)

Solution B (Four-Sensor Vehicle Priority System)

Solution C (Modified Four-Sensor System)

A real-world example from Australia is also provided to connect theory with practical applications.

Step 3 – Evaluating Alternatives

All three proposed solutions are compared based on simplicity, safety, reliability, cost, and feasibility. The trade-offs are analysed in a structured table format.

Step 4 – Engineering Decision Making

The evaluation leads to the selection of Solution A – The Two-Sensor System as the most effective option due to its balance of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and reliability.

Step 5 – Planning and Implementing

This section contains the plain-English sequence of tasks describing how the system operates, step-by-step, once installed.

Step 6 – Flowchart Representation

The flowchart provides a visual representation of the logic for Solution A, illustrating decision points and processes clearly using standard flowchart symbols.

Step 7 – Testing and Refinement

Link: https://github.com/shomitbasu/train-gates-project/tree/a6f1a80b64f49ed01a0dcef5e29a27896af91de7/Step7_Testing%20and%20Refinement

All eight possible test cases (based on three binary inputs) are evaluated. A comparison of expected vs actual outputs highlights that the system largely works as designed, with minor practical adjustments for safety-critical cases. Suggestions for refinements are also included, such as regulating train speeds, optimising motion detectors, and introducing a short delay before reopening the gates.
